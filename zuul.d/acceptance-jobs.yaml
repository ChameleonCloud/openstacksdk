      Acceptance test of the OpenStackSDK on real clouds.

      .. zuul:jobsvar::openstack_credentials
        :type: dict

        This is expected to be a Zuul Secret with these keys:

        .. zuul:jobvar: auth
          :type: dict

           Dictionary with authentication information with mandatory auth_url
           and others. The structure mimics `clouds.yaml` structure.

      By default all jobs that inherit from here are non voting.
